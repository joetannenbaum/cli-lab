As an entrepreneur, I have always been driven by the desire to innovate and create something that brings value to people's lives. But, my interests go far beyond business. I am a passionate traveler, enthusiastic rider, and a true believer in the power of giving back to the society.

As the co-founder and CTO of ViitorCloud, a technology company that is always pushing the boundaries of innovation and excellence, I have had the privilege of working with some of the brightest minds in the industry. I am also the organizer of Laracon, the leading Laravel community in India.

Charity is an important part of my life, and I strongly believe in contributing to the community. But, I am not all work and no play. In my free time, you can find me riding my Harley, exploring new places, or enjoying parties with my friends. I am a man of energy and surrounded by passionate, happy souls who inspire me to live my life to the fullest.
